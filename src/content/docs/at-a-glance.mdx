## What's this?
This is the website for the `m3ripple` library. \
`m3ripple` is a **React** library to show ripple effect like android 12 or later on the Web.

## Why m3ripple?

### On the Web
You can implement beautiful ripple effect with **Sparkle Effect** easily to your Web Projects. \
`m3ripple` provides the `RippleContainer` component. \
Simply wrap the element to which you want to apply the ripple effect with it.

### Well-Tuned
Implementing even a basic version of the Ripple Effect can be a surprisingly complex task. And as you aim to improve its completeness and polish, things get even more complicated.\
\
For example, when a `touchstart` event is triggered on a touch-enabled device, should the Ripple Effect always be rendered?\
Not necessarily — the event might have been triggered simply because a finger happened to be over the element during a scroll.\
How should we handle such cases?\
\
Additionally, on touch-enabled devices, a tap triggers not only `touchstart` and `touchend` but also `mousedown` and `mouseup`. This can cause the Ripple Effect to appear twice unless proper precautions are taken.\
\
Handling all these different cases — especially if this interaction is not the main focus of your project — can be challenging and time-consuming to do on your own for just a single effect.\
\
That’s exactly why you should consider using **m3ripple**.

### Customizable
m3ripple offers a variety of customization options for the Ripple Effect.\
\
To implement the Ripple Effect, you need to wrap your target element with a `RippleContainer`. Not only can you add a className to this container, but you can also control a wide range of properties — including the Ripple color, sparkle color, amount, opacity transitions, and even a callback function to be executed just before the effect is triggered.\
\
Additionally, since RippleContainer ultimately renders as a `div` element, you can freely pass in almost any native div properties you need.

### High Speed
The Ripple Effect is rendered using the Web Animations API, while the sparkles are drawn on a single `<canvas>` element.\
\
This approach is significantly more efficient compared to alternatives such as using a large number of `<div>` elements or multiple canvas layers — both of which I had previously experimented with.\
\
Before switching to this rendering method, it was difficult to achieve smooth sparkle animations in Firefox. However, with the current implementation, performance is now within a practical range (and on Chromium-based browsers, the experience is very smooth).

### Material 2
Want to use the Ripple Effect from Material 2?\
\
While it's not actively maintained and therefore not recommended, I’ve prepared a carefully recreated version — and it works reliably!\
\
All you need to do is pass false to the `isMaterial3` option on `RippleContainer`.

## Try
You can try it out on the [Examples page](/examples/).
